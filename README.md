# Mathematical Modeling of Disease Spread

This repository contains a short write‑up and presentation material on compartmental models in epidemiology.  The main report is written in LaTeX and analyses simple SI, IR and SIS models.  All figures used in the text and slides are generated by a small Python script.

## Repository layout

- `main.tex` – main report (compile with `pdflatex` or `latexmk`)
- `presentation1_3.tex`, `presentation3_6.tex` – Beamer slides for week‑wise presentations
- `figures.py` – script that produces all PDF illustrations
- `references.bib` – BibTeX bibliography file used in the report
- `*.pdf` – pre‑generated figures included for convenience

## Generating the figures

The Python script relies on **NumPy**, **SciPy** and **Matplotlib**.  After installing these packages, run

```bash
python3 figures.py
```

All output is placed in a directory named `Figures/`.  The files are written as vector PDF so they can be included directly in the LaTeX sources.

## Building the documents

Any modern TeX distribution with `pdflatex` is sufficient.  For example, to build the main report

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

Similarly, the Beamer slides can be compiled via `pdflatex presentation1_3.tex` (or `presentation3_6.tex`).  Tools such as `latexmk` can automate these steps.
